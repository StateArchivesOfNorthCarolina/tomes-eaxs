# TOMES EAXS

##Part of the [TOMES](https://www.ncdcr.gov/resources/records-management/tomes) project: the EAXS schema

**EAXS** stands for *Email Account XML Schema*. 

EAXS is designed to store the information found in a single e-mail account. The schema was developed by the [State Archives of North Carolina](https://archives.ncdcr.gov) and the [Smithsonian Institution Archives](https://siarchives.si.edu) circa 2008.

This repository was specifically developed for the TOMES project in order to provide the following:

1. A version-controlled location for the EAXS schema files and documentation. 
	- This includes an experimental JSON mapping of the XSD.
2. A new namespace name: `https://github.com/StateArchivesOfNorthCarolina/tomes-eaxs`
3. A new schema location: `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/StateArchivesOfNorthCarolina/tomes-eaxs/master/eaxs_schema.xsd`
